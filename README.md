# Fire Post

FirePost is a web3 social media with an ERC20 token FIRE.

FirePost fires you everyday at a random time with a instruction of taking a photo. For example: "Take a photo of a funny spegetti !". Users get FIRE for reward to post, and they can use FIRE to like the others post with quadratic voting(liking), which means you can like not only once! The post who gets the highest like of the day in the chain gets more FIRE for reward. FIREs can not only be used to like, but be used to exchange for NFTs.
